# Datacamp: Na√Øve Bees Image Loading and Processing
##### Load, transform, and understand images of honey bees and bumble bees in Python.

## Project Description
##### Can a machine distinguish between a honey bee and a bumble bee? Being able to identify bee species from images, while challenging, would allow researchers to more quickly and effectively collect field data. In this Project, you will use the Python image library Pillow to load and manipulate image data. You'll learn common transformations of images and how to build them into a pipeline.


##### This project is the first part of a series of Projects that walk through working with image data, building classifiers using traditional techniques, and leveraging the power of deep learning for computer vision.

## Project Task
- Import Python libraries
- Opening images with PIL

- Images as arrays of data
- Explore the color channels
- Honey bees and bumble bees (i)
- Honey bees and bumble bees (ii)
- Simplify, simplify, simplify
- Save your work!
- Make a pipeline
